title: Cross-Chain Messaging
description: "How messages flow securely between TON and TAC EVM through the TON Adapter's validation and consensus system"
---

Cross-chain messaging is the foundation of TAC's hybrid dApp functionality. It enables secure communication between TON users and EVM smart contracts through a structured system of message creation, validation, and execution. Understanding this messaging system helps developers build more effective applications and troubleshoot issues when they arise.

<Info>
  **Current Network Status**: The sequencer network is currently distributed but
  not decentralized. Full decentralization is on the roadmap as the network
  matures.

## Message Structure

Cross-chain messages contain all the information needed for secure validation and execution across different blockchain architectures.

### Core Message Components

Every message includes essential metadata and operation-specific data:

```javascript
{
  timestamp: 1640995200,              // TON blockchain timestamp
  target: "0x742d35Cc6473...",        // Target smart contract address
  methodName: "swapTokens(bytes,bytes)", // Method signature
  arguments: "0x1234...",             // Encoded method parameters
  caller: "EQAbc123...",              // Original TON caller address
  mintTokens: [...],                  // Tokens to mint on TAC EVM
  unlockTokens: [...]                 // Tokens to unlock from previous operations
}
```

### TAC Header Information

The TON Adapter automatically augments messages with additional metadata that proxy contracts receive:

<Accordion title="TAC Header Fields" icon="info">

- **shardsKey**: Unique identifier linking related transactions when multiple tokens are involved in a single operation.

- **timestamp**: Block timestamp from the TON blockchain where the user's original message was created.

- **operationId**: Unique identifier generated by TAC infrastructure for tracking and validation purposes.

- **tvmCaller**: The TON user's wallet address that initiated the cross-chain operation.

- **extraData**: Additional data provided by sequencers during execution, typically empty but available for special use cases.

</Accordion>

### Parameter Encoding

Application-specific parameters are encoded using standard Ethereum ABI encoding:

```javascript
// Example: DEX swap parameters
const abi = new ethers.AbiCoder();
const swapParams = abi.encode(
  ["tuple(address,address,uint256,uint256,address,uint256)"],
  [[tokenIn, tokenOut, amountIn, minAmountOut, recipient, deadline]]
);
```

This encoding ensures that EVM proxy contracts can decode parameters correctly while maintaining compatibility with standard Ethereum tooling.

## Validation Process

The TON Adapter employs multiple layers of validation to ensure message integrity and prevent malicious activity.

### Asset Verification

- **Transfer Validation**: Sequencers verify that actual token transfers match the amounts specified in cross-chain messages. This prevents attempts to claim false transfer amounts or access unauthorized funds.

- **Balance Checking**: User balances are validated against requested operations to ensure sufficient assets are available for the intended operation.

- **Metadata Consistency**: Token information and operation parameters are cross-referenced to ensure consistency throughout the validation process.

### Cryptographic Validation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Merkle Proofs">

    - **Inclusion Proofs**: Every executed message includes cryptographic proof of
    inclusion in a consensus-approved Merkle tree.
    - **Tamper Resistance**: Merkle proofs make it cryptographically impossible
      to modify messages after consensus without detection.
    - **Independent Verification**: Any party can verify message authenticity
      using the public Merkle proofs.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Consensus Signatures">

    - **Multi-Group Agreement**: Messages require agreement from multiple
    independent sequencer groups before execution.
    - **Economic Security**: Sequencer groups stake significant collateral, creating financial incentives
    for honest validation.
    - **Threshold Requirements**: The network requires sufficient group participation to ensure security while maintaining
    operational efficiency.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Epoch-Based Processing

TAC organizes message processing into time-based epochs that provide structure and predictability to cross-chain operations.

### Epoch Structure

**Deterministic Timing**: Each epoch is calculated using a precise formula that ensures all sequencers work with the same time boundaries:

```
EpochId = (currentTime - protocolDeployTime) / epochDuration
```

**Processing Windows**: Messages are collected and processed within specific timeframes:

```
[protocolDeployTime + EpochId × epochDuration,
 protocolDeployTime + (EpochId + 1) × epochDuration]
```

### Benefits of Epoch Processing

- **Ordered Processing**: All sequencers process the same set of messages in each epoch, preventing timing-based attacks and ensuring consistency.

- **Batch Efficiency**: Processing messages in batches is more efficient than individual handling and provides better consensus guarantees.

- **Predictable Latency**: Users and applications can estimate processing times based on epoch duration and current network status.

## Message Types and Flows

Different types of cross-chain operations follow distinct patterns that affect how messages are structured and processed.

### One-Way Messages (TON → TAC)

- **Simple Operations**: Basic token transfers, contract calls that don't require return values, or operations where results remain on the EVM side.

- **Message Flow**: TON user → TON Adapter → Sequencer validation → EVM execution → Completion notification.

- **Use Cases**: Token deposits, simple contract interactions, or operations where users only need confirmation of completion.

### Round-Trip Messages (TON → TAC → TON)

- **Complex Operations**: Operations that generate results or assets that need to be returned to the original TON user.

- **Extended Flow**: Includes an additional return path where EVM proxy contracts create new messages to send results back through the TON Adapter.

- **Use Cases**: Token swaps, liquidity operations, or any interaction where users expect to receive different assets or data back.

### Rollback Operations

<Warning>
  When operations fail on the target chain, TAC automatically initiates rollback
  procedures to protect user assets.
</Warning>

- **Automatic Triggers**: Failed executions on either chain automatically trigger rollback message creation to return assets safely.

- **Asset Protection**: Rollback messages ensure that locked or transferred assets are returned to users when operations cannot complete successfully.

- **Special Processing**: Rollback messages receive priority processing to minimize the time users wait for asset recovery.

## Error Handling and Recovery

TAC's messaging system includes comprehensive error handling mechanisms that protect user assets and provide clear feedback about operation status.

### Failure Detection

**Execution Monitoring**: The system continuously monitors message execution on target chains and detects various types of failures.

**Timeout Handling**: Messages that don't complete within expected timeframes trigger automatic timeout procedures.

**Validation Failures**: Messages that fail validation at any stage are rejected before execution to prevent resource waste.

### Recovery Mechanisms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automatic Rollback" icon="undo">
    When transactions fail after asset transfers have occurred, the system
    automatically creates rollback messages to return assets to their original
    owners. This process uses the same consensus mechanisms as regular messages,
    ensuring that rollbacks are secure and verifiable.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Failed Transaction Collection" icon="trash">
  Failed transactions are collected into special Merkle trees and processed
  through the consensus system to ensure proper resolution. This systematic
  approach prevents failed transactions from being lost or forgotten while
  maintaining the same security standards.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Status Reporting" icon="chart-line">
    Comprehensive status reporting allows applications to detect failures
    quickly and provide users with clear information about what happened and
    what to expect. Status information includes failure reasons when available,
    helping users understand issues and potential resolution steps.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Message Security Guarantees

The cross-chain messaging system provides strong security guarantees through multiple redundant mechanisms.

### Economic Security

- **Stake Requirements**: Sequencers must stake significant collateral to participate in message validation, creating strong financial incentives for honest behavior.

- **Slashing Mechanisms**: Provably incorrect behavior results in automatic collateral slashing, making attacks economically unattractive.

- **Reward Alignment**: Performance-based rewards encourage reliable operation and continued network participation.

### Technical Security

- **Consensus Thresholds**: High consensus requirements (3/5 within groups, multiple groups for network consensus) make coordination attacks extremely difficult.

- **Cryptographic Verification**: Merkle proofs and digital signatures provide mathematical guarantees of message integrity and authenticity.

- **Redundant Validation**: Multiple independent parties validate each message, preventing single points of failure or manipulation.
