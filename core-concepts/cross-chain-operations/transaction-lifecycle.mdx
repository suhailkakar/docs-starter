title: Transaction Lifecycle
description: "Complete journey of cross-chain transactions from user initiation to final execution and confirmation"
---

The transaction lifecycle in TAC represents the complete journey of a cross-chain operation from initial user action to final confirmation. Understanding this lifecycle helps developers build better applications, implement proper status tracking, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

## Lifecycle Overview

Every cross-chain transaction follows a predictable path through multiple validation and execution stages across different blockchain networks and consensus systems.

<Frame caption="Complete transaction lifecycle showing all stages from initiation to completion">

    alt="Transaction lifecycle diagram with all stages"
  />
</Frame>

The lifecycle involves three main phases: **Initiation** (user action), **Processing** (validation and consensus), and **Execution** (target chain operations). Each phase includes multiple stages that ensure security and reliability.

## Stage Progression

Cross-chain transactions progress through specific stages that can be monitored and tracked for status updates.

### TON-Side Stages

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Initiation" icon="mouse-pointer-2">
    User connects their TON wallet and approves a transaction in a hybrid dApp.
    The TAC SDK formats the request and prepares assets for cross-chain
    transfer.
  </Step>

<Step title="Asset Locking" icon="lock">
  User's tokens are locked in the TON Adapter contracts, creating the foundation
  for cross-chain asset representation on the target chain.
</Step>

<Step title="Message Creation" icon="message-circle">
  A structured cross-chain message is created containing all operation details,
  target information, and asset specifications.
</Step>

  <Step title="Event Emission" icon="network">
    The TON transaction completes and emits events that sequencers monitor for
    cross-chain processing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Sequencer Processing Stages

The sequencer network handles message validation and consensus formation:

<Accordion title="COLLECTED_IN_TAC" icon="database">
  - **Message Detection**: Sequencers detect the cross-chain event and store transaction details in their local databases for validation.

- **Initial Validation**: Each sequencer independently validates the transaction parameters, asset transfers, and user authorization.

- **Database Storage**: Validated transactions are stored and prepared for inclusion in the next Merkle tree formation cycle.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="INCLUDED_IN_TAC_CONSENSUS" icon="network">
  - **Merkle Tree Formation**: Sequencers compile validated transactions into Merkle trees at the end of each epoch period.

- **Group Consensus**: Sequencer groups work to achieve 66% internal agreement on their Merkle tree root hashes.

- **Network Submission**: Successfully agreed-upon trees are submitted to the network for cross-group validation and consensus.

</Accordion>

### EVM Execution Stages

<Accordion title="EXECUTED_IN_TAC" icon="play">
  - **Consensus Verification**: The CrossChainLayer contract verifies that sufficient sequencer groups have submitted matching Merkle trees.

- **Asset Operations**: Required token minting or unlocking operations are performed before contract execution.

- **Contract Invocation**: The target EVM proxy contract is called with properly formatted parameters and bridged assets.

- **Result Recording**: Execution results are recorded on-chain, including any return messages or asset operations.

</Accordion>

### Return Path Stages (If Applicable)

For operations that send results back to TON:

<Accordion title="COLLECTED_IN_TON" icon="arrow-left">
  - **Return Message Creation**: EVM proxy contracts create return messages containing results or assets to send back to TON.

- **Sequencer Detection**: The same sequencer network detects return messages and begins validation for the reverse journey.

- **Asset Preparation**: Any assets being returned are prepared for the burn-and-release process back to TON.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="INCLUDED_IN_TON_CONSENSUS" icon="handshake">
- **Return Consensus**: Return messages go through the same consensus process as forward messages, ensuring security.

- **Cross-Group Validation**: Multiple sequencer groups must agree on return message validity before execution.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="EXECUTED_IN_TON" icon="circle-check">
- **Final Execution**: Return messages are executed on TON, delivering results or assets back to the original user.

- **Transaction Completion**: The cross-chain operation is fully complete, with all stages successfully executed.

</Accordion>

## Operation Types

Different transaction patterns result in different lifecycle flows, each with distinct characteristics and completion criteria.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TON_TAC">

    - **One-Way Operations**: Transactions that move assets or data from TON to TAC EVM without requiring a return path.
    - **Examples**: Simple token deposits, contract calls that store results on EVM, or operations where users only need confirmation.
    - **Completion**: These operations complete at the EXECUTED_IN_TAC stage, making them faster than round-trip operations.
    - **Use Cases**: Token bridging for holding, deposits into EVM protocols, or data submissions that don't require responses.

  </Tab>

<Tab title="TON_TAC_TON">

- **Round-Trip Operations**: Complete cycles where operations execute on EVM and send results back to the original TON user.
- **Examples**: Token swaps, liquidity operations that return LP tokens, or any interaction where users expect different assets back.
- **Completion**: These operations complete at the EXECUTED_IN_TON stage after the full round trip.
- **Use Cases**: DEX swaps, yield farming, lending operations, or any complex DeFi interaction.

</Tab>

  <Tab title="ROLLBACK">

    - **Failed Operations**: Transactions that encounter errors during execution and trigger automatic asset recovery procedures.
    - **Triggers**: EVM execution failures, invalid parameters, insufficient gas, or other error conditions.
    - **Asset Protection**: The rollback process ensures user assets are returned safely even when operations fail.
    - **Recovery**: Rollback operations follow their own consensus path to ensure secure asset recovery.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Timing and Performance

Understanding transaction timing helps developers set appropriate user expectations and design responsive interfaces.

### Typical Timeframes

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fast Operations" icon="gauge">
    **TON_TAC Operations**: 3-5 minutes Simple one-way operations complete
    relatively quickly since they don't require a return path through the
    consensus system.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Complete Operations" icon="clock">
    **TON_TAC_TON Operations**: 6-12 minutes Round-trip operations take longer
    due to the additional consensus and execution cycles required for the return
    path.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Factors Affecting Speed

- **Epoch Duration**: The length of sequencer processing windows directly affects how quickly transactions progress through consensus stages.

- **Network Participation**: Higher sequencer participation generally leads to faster consensus formation and execution.

- **Target Chain Congestion**: Busy periods on either TON or TAC EVM can slow execution stages.

- **Operation Complexity**: Simple operations process faster than complex multi-token or multi-contract interactions.

## Status Tracking

Applications can monitor transaction progress through various tracking mechanisms that provide different levels of detail.

### Simplified Status Tracking

For user-facing interfaces, simplified status provides clear, understandable progress information:

```javascript
const tracker = new OperationTracker(Network.TESTNET);
const status = await tracker.getSimplifiedOperationStatus(transactionLinker);

switch (status) {
  case "PENDING":
    // Transaction is progressing through stages
    break;
  case "SUCCESSFUL":
    // Operation completed successfully
    break;
  case "FAILED":
    // Operation failed and assets were rolled back
    break;
  case "OPERATION_ID_NOT_FOUND":
    // Transaction not yet detected by sequencers
    break;
}
```

### Detailed Stage Tracking

For debugging or advanced interfaces, detailed tracking shows exact stage progression:

```javascript
const operationId = await tracker.getOperationId(transactionLinker);
const detailedStatus = await tracker.getOperationStatus(operationId);

console.log(`Current stage: ${detailedStatus.stage}`);
console.log(`Success status: ${detailedStatus.success}`);
console.log(`Stage timestamp: ${new Date(detailedStatus.timestamp * 1000)}`);
```

### Performance Profiling

Advanced tracking provides timing information for each stage:

```javascript
const stageProfile = await tracker.getStageProfiling(operationId);

// Shows timing for each completed stage
Object.keys(stageProfile).forEach((stageName) => {
  if (stageName === "operationType") return;

  const stage = stageProfile[stageName];
  if (stage.exists) {
    console.log(`${stageName}: ${stage.stageData.timestamp}`);
  }
});
```

## Error Handling Throughout the Lifecycle

The transaction lifecycle includes comprehensive error handling at every stage to protect user assets and provide clear feedback.

### Pre-Execution Validation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Client-Side Validation" icon="shield-check">
    - **Parameter Checking**: The TAC SDK validates transaction parameters before submission to prevent obvious errors.
    - **Balance Verification**: User balances are checked against requested operations to ensure sufficient assets.
    - **Gas Estimation**: Automatic gas estimation helps prevent failures due to insufficient gas limits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sequencer Validation" icon="search">
    - **Asset Verification**: Sequencers verify that claimed asset transfers actually occurred on-chain.
    - **Message Integrity**: Transaction parameters are validated against on-chain data to prevent manipulation.
    - **Authorization Checks**: Only authorized users can initiate operations for their assets.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Execution-Time Errors

- **EVM Execution Failures**: If target contract calls fail on TAC EVM, the system automatically initiates rollback procedures.

- **Timeout Handling**: Operations that don't complete within expected timeframes trigger timeout procedures.

- **Network Issues**: Temporary network problems are handled through retry mechanisms and status preservation.

### Rollback Procedures

<Warning>
  When transactions fail after assets have been transferred, TAC automatically
  protects user funds through secure rollback mechanisms.
</Warning>

- **Automatic Triggers**: Failed operations automatically create rollback messages that return assets to their original owners.

- **Consensus Protection**: Rollback operations go through the same consensus validation as regular transactions.

- **Asset Recovery**: Users receive their original assets back even when target operations cannot complete successfully.

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Real-Time Monitoring

Applications can implement real-time monitoring to provide users with live updates:

```javascript
async function monitorTransaction(transactionLinker) {
  const tracker = new OperationTracker(Network.TESTNET);

  // Poll for operation ID
  let operationId = null;
  while (!operationId) {
    operationId = await tracker.getOperationId(transactionLinker);
    if (!operationId) {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
    }
  }

  // Monitor until completion
  let completed = false;
  while (!completed) {
    const status = await tracker.getOperationStatus(operationId);

    // Update UI with current status
    updateUserInterface(status);

    // Check for completion
    if (status.stage === "EXECUTED_IN_TON" || !status.success) {
      completed = true;
    } else {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10000));
    }
  }
}
```

### Debugging Failed Transactions

- **Status Analysis**: Detailed status information helps identify where transactions failed and why.

- **Stage Timing**: Performance profiling can reveal if transactions are stuck at particular stages.

- **Error Messages**: When available, error messages provide specific information about failure causes.

- **Asset Tracking**: Applications can verify that rollback procedures properly returned user assets.

## Best Practices for Developers

### User Experience Design

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Progress Communication">
    - **Clear Expectations**: Inform users that cross-chain operations take several minutes to complete.
    - **Progress Indicators**: Show users which stage their transaction is currently in using progress bars or step indicators.
    - **Time Estimates**: Provide realistic time estimates based on current network conditions and operation type.
  </Tab>

<Tab title="Error Handling">
  - **Graceful Failures**: Handle failed transactions gracefully with clear
  explanations of what happened. - **Recovery Guidance**: Provide users with
  information about asset recovery and next steps after failures. - **Support
  Information**: Include transaction IDs and status information that support
  teams can use for assistance.
</Tab>

  <Tab title="Performance Optimization">
    - **Optimistic UI**: Update interfaces optimistically while monitoring actual transaction progress.
    - **Efficient Polling**: Use reasonable polling intervals that balance responsiveness with resource usage.
    - **Caching**: Cache status information appropriately to reduce unnecessary API calls.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Integration Patterns

- **Status Webhooks**: For applications that need server-side monitoring, implement webhook endpoints for status updates.

- **Background Processing**: Handle long-running transaction monitoring in background processes rather than blocking user interfaces.

- **Retry Logic**: Implement appropriate retry logic for temporary network issues while avoiding excessive API usage.
