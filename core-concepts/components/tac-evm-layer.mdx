The TAC EVM Layer is a fully sovereign Layer 1 blockchain that provides complete Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility. Built on the latest Cosmos SDK with native EVM integration, it serves as the execution environment where all hybrid dApp smart contracts run, offering developers the familiar Ethereum experience.

## Technical Foundation

TAC EVM Layer combines proven blockchain technologies to deliver a robust execution environment that feels familiar to Ethereum developers.

### Core Technology Stack

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cosmos SDK - Application Framework" icon="blocks">
    The latest Cosmos SDK provides the modular blockchain framework that powers
    TAC EVM Layer. This battle-tested foundation offers built-in modules for
    staking, governance, and inter-blockchain communication, while allowing
    custom modules for TAC-specific functionality. 
    
    The SDK's modular architecture enables TAC to implement features like the TON Adapter
    integration directly at the blockchain level, rather than as external
    bolt-on solutions.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Native EVM Integration" icon="settings">

TAC EVM Layer implements native EVM execution directly within the Cosmos SDK
framework. This isn't a compatibility layer or virtual machine running on top
of another VM - it's true EVM execution with modern consensus guarantees.

Every Ethereum opcode, gas calculation, and state transition rule works
exactly as it does on Ethereum mainnet, ensuring 100% compatibility for
existing Solidity contracts.

## Performance Characteristics

TAC EVM Layer maintains the security guarantees developers expect from a production blockchain built on Cosmos SDK.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Finality">

    **Immediate finality** means transactions are
    irreversibly confirmed the moment they appear in a block. There's no waiting
    period for additional confirmations - one confirmation is enough.

    **No reorganizations** are possible due to Tendermint's consensus model. This
    eliminates edge cases where transactions might be reversed or reordered
    after confirmation.

  </Tab>

<Tab title="Throughput">

**Configurable gas limits** allow the network to adapt to demand through
governance proposals, balancing throughput with
decentralization requirements.

**Parallel execution potential** exists within the Cosmos SDK framework, enabling future optimizations as the network grows.

</Tab>

  <Tab title="Cost Efficiency">

    **EIP-1559 gas management** provides predictable transaction fees with
    automatic fee adjustment based on network demand. Users get the same fee
    predictability they expect from modern Ethereum.

    **Fee token flexibility** allows transaction fees to be paid in TAC tokens, while still
    supporting ETH-denominated gas calculations for contract compatibility.

## Security Model

TAC EVM Layer employs a dual-layer security approach that provides both immediate operational security and long-term economic security.

### Primary Security: Delegated Proof of Stake

The core security of TAC EVM Layer comes from a delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism built on the latest Cosmos SDK.

- **Validator Selection**: The network supports a configurable number of validators (to be determined before mainnet launch). Anyone can become a validator by staking TAC tokens and maintaining the required infrastructure.

- **Delegation System**: TAC token holders can delegate their stake to validators, earning rewards while contributing to network security. This allows broader participation in securing the network without requiring users to run validator infrastructure.

- **Immediate Finality**: The BFT consensus provides immediate finality with a 67% supermajority requirement. This means transactions are final the moment they're included in a block, with no possibility of reversal.

- **Slashing Protection**: Validators face automatic slashing for provable misbehavior like double-signing or extended downtime. This creates strong economic incentives for reliable, honest participation.

### Enhanced Security: Babylon Bitcoin Staking

TAC EVM Layer integrates with Babylon's Bitcoin staking protocol to add an additional layer of economic security.

<Warning>
  Bitcoin staking provides enhanced security but introduces slight delays in
  finality. Most applications can rely on the immediate dPoS finality for
  optimal user experience.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Bitcoin Staking Works" icon="bitcoin">

    Bitcoin holders can stake their BTC in a self-custodial manner directly on
    the Bitcoin blockchain. They delegate to Babylon validators who then provide
    additional signatures on TAC EVM Layer blocks.

    If a Babylon validator double-signs a TAC block, the Babylon protocol automatically slashes the
    staked Bitcoin, providing economic security proportional to the amount of
    Bitcoin at stake.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Security Benefits" icon="shield-check">

The Bitcoin staking layer adds massive economic security to TAC EVM Layer. An
attacker would need to overcome both the dPoS validators and the Bitcoin
stakers, making attacks exponentially more expensive.

This dual security model provides some of the strongest economic guarantees available in the blockchain
space, backed by Bitcoin's security budget.

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finality Trade-offs" icon="clock">

    While dPoS provides immediate finality, Bitcoin-secured finality takes
    longer due to Bitcoin's block times and the additional validation required.

    Most applications can treat dPoS finality as sufficient for operational
    purposes while benefiting from the enhanced long-term security of Bitcoin
    staking.

</AccordionGroup>

## Gas and Fee Structure

TAC EVM Layer implements familiar gas mechanics with improvements for predictability and efficiency.

### EIP-1559 Implementation

TAC EVM Layer uses EIP-1559 gas pricing for predictable transaction fees:

```solidity
// Gas calculations work exactly like Ethereum
uint256 gasUsed = gasLimit - gasleft();
uint256 effectiveGasPrice = baseFee + min(maxPriorityFee, maxFeePerGas - baseFee);
uint256 totalCost = gasUsed * effectiveGasPrice;
```

- **Base Fee**: Automatically adjusts based on network congestion, providing predictable pricing for users.

- **Priority Fee**: Allows users to pay extra for faster inclusion during high-demand periods.

- **Fee Burning**: A portion of transaction fees are burned, creating deflationary pressure on TAC tokens.

## Integration with TON Adapter

TAC EVM Layer includes native integration points for the TON Adapter system, enabling seamless cross-chain functionality.

### Cross-Chain Layer Contract

A system-level contract manages all interactions with the TON Adapter:

```solidity
interface ICrossChainLayer {
    function receiveMessage(
        bytes32 messageHash,
        bytes calldata merkleProof,
        MessageData calldata message
    ) external;

    function sendMessage(
        OutMessageV1 calldata outMessage
    ) external;
}
```

This contract is deployed at the genesis block and handles all cross-chain message routing, asset operations, and validation.

### Asset Management

TAC EVM Layer includes specialized contracts for managing bridged assets from TON:

- **Token Factory**: Automatically deploys ERC-20 contracts for TON jettons when they first cross to TAC EVM Layer.

- **Asset Registry**: Maintains the mapping between TON asset addresses and their TAC EVM equivalents.

- **Bridge Contracts**: Handle the locking and unlocking of assets as they move between chains.
