title: Sequencer Network
description: "The distributed network of nodes that validates and processes cross-chain messages through consensus"
---

The Sequencer Network is the operational backbone of the TON Adapter, consisting of distributed nodes that collect, validate, and reach consensus on cross-chain messages. These sequencers ensure that messages between TON and TAC EVM are processed securely and reliably through a multi-layered validation system.

<Info>
  **Current Network Status**: The sequencer network is currently distributed but
  not decentralized. Full decentralization is on the roadmap as the network
  matures.
</Info>

## Core Functions

Sequencers perform several critical functions that enable secure cross-chain communication:

- **Transaction Collection**: Sequencers continuously monitor both TON and TAC EVM chains for relevant events. When users initiate cross-chain operations, sequencers detect these events and store them in local databases for processing.

- **Data Validation**: Before participating in consensus, each sequencer validates transaction data locally. This includes verifying that asset transfers match message parameters and ensuring users have sufficient balances for requested operations.

- **Merkle Tree Formation**: At regular intervals determined by network parameters, sequencers compile validated transactions into Merkle trees. These trees provide cryptographic proof of transaction inclusion and enable efficient consensus.

- **Consensus Participation**: Sequencers work together in groups to reach agreement on transaction validity, with each group requiring 3/5 internal consensus before submitting to the broader network.

## Sequencer Groups

The network organizes individual sequencers into groups to enhance security through redundancy and distributed validation.

### Group Formation and Management

- **Approval Process**: Sequencer groups are not permissionless - they require approval through DAO voting or multisig processes. This ensures that only trusted entities with proper infrastructure and incentives can participate in securing cross-chain messages.

- **Group Composition**: Each group contains multiple sequencer nodes owned by a specific entity. This could be a trusted dApp, infrastructure provider, or other stakeholder with strong incentives to maintain network security.

- **Internal Operations**: Within each group, sequencers operate independently but must coordinate to reach consensus. This internal redundancy protects against individual node failures while maintaining group-level reliability.

### Economic Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Collateral Requirements" icon="coins">
    Each sequencer group must maintain approved collateral above a minimum threshold:
    
    - **Liquid Staking Tokens**: stTON (TON Liquid Staking Tokens)
    - **Ethereum LSTs**: wstETH, stETH (when Agglayer integration is live)
    - **Other DAO-approved**: Additional liquid staking derivatives as voted by governance
    - Minimum threshold set by DAO governance
    - Higher collateral demonstrates stronger commitment and earns proportionally higher rewards
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stake Management" icon="chart-line">
  Groups can modify their collateral when changing proofs, but there are
  protections in place to prevent abuse. If an incorrect proof is submitted,
  there's a time window for other groups to issue penalties before collateral
  can be withdrawn. This system ensures that groups maintain skin in the game
  throughout their participation in the network.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Profitability Incentives" icon="trending-up">
    Higher collateral amounts lead to increased profitability, creating natural
    incentives for groups to stake substantial amounts. 
    
    This aligns economic incentives with network security requirements.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Consensus Mechanism

The sequencer network achieves consensus through a multi-layer validation process that ensures security while maintaining operational efficiency.

### Network-Level Consensus

- **Cross-Group Validation**: For a Merkle tree to be accepted by the network, multiple independent groups must submit identical trees. This requirement prevents any single group from manipulating the message flow or processing incorrect transactions.

- **Consensus Threshold**: The network requires agreement from enough groups to ensure security. This threshold is configurable through DAO governance to balance security requirements with operational efficiency.

- **Tree Application**: Only when sufficient groups submit matching trees does the CrossChainLayer smart contract accept the tree for transaction execution.

## Transaction Processing Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Event Detection" icon="radar">
    Sequencers monitor both TON and TAC EVM chains for cross-chain events. When
    a user initiates a transaction, multiple sequencers detect it simultaneously
    and begin validation processes.
  </Step>

<Step title="Local Validation" icon="shield-check">
  Each sequencer validates the transaction locally, checking asset transfers,
  user balances, and message parameters. Only valid transactions proceed to the
  next stage.
</Step>

<Step title="Database Storage" icon="database">
  Validated transactions are stored in each sequencer's local database, creating
  a distributed record of all cross-chain activity during the current epoch.
</Step>

<Step title="Merkle Tree Creation" icon="network">
  At the end of each epoch, sequencers compile their validated transactions into
  Merkle trees and submit root hashes to their respective SequencerGroup
  contracts.
</Step>

<Step title="Group Consensus" icon="users">
  Groups work to reach 3/5 internal agreement on their Merkle trees.
  Successfully agreed-upon trees are submitted to the network for cross-group
  validation.
</Step>

<Step title="Network Consensus" icon="handshake">
  Multiple groups must submit identical trees for network acceptance. Once
  sufficient groups agree, the tree becomes eligible for execution.
</Step>

  <Step title="Transaction Execution" icon="play">
    Validated transactions are executed on the target chain using cryptographic
    proofs from the consensus-approved Merkle trees.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Economic Security Model

The sequencer network's security relies on economic incentives that align participant behavior with network health.

### Reward Structure

- **Stake-Based Selection**: Executors are chosen for specific transactions based on their collateral amounts. Higher stake increases the probability of selection and larger potential rewards.

- **Proportional Distribution**: At the end of each execution round, rewards are distributed proportionally to sequencer stakes, regardless of who actually performed the execution.

- **Performance Incentives**: This system incentivizes sequencers to maintain higher collateral commitments while ensuring rewards are fairly distributed based on economic contribution.

### Penalty Mechanisms

<Warning>
  The network includes robust penalty systems to discourage malicious behavior
  and maintain security standards.
</Warning>

- **Penalty Applications**: Other sequencer groups can submit penalty applications to the Penalty smart contract when they detect incorrect behavior or invalid proofs.

- **Collateral Locking**: If enough groups agree on a penalty application, partial collateral locking occurs while the penalty is investigated and resolved.

- **Network Voting**: Penalty resolution happens through network-wide voting, ensuring that punishments are applied fairly and only when warranted.

## Epoch-Based Processing

The sequencer network operates on an epoch-based system that provides structure and predictability to cross-chain message processing.

### Epoch Structure

- **Time-Based Windows**: Each epoch represents a specific time period during which transactions are collected and processed together. The epoch duration is configurable through DAO governance.

- **Deterministic Timing**: Epoch boundaries are calculated using the formula:

```
EpochId = (currentTime - protocolDeployTime) / epochDuration
```

- **Processing Boundaries**: Transactions are processed within specific timeframes:

```
[protocolDeployTime + EpochId × epochDuration,
 protocolDeployTime + (EpochId + 1) × epochDuration]
```

### Benefits of Epoch Processing

- **Ordered Processing**: The epoch system ensures that all sequencers work with the same set of transactions, preventing timing-based attacks and inconsistencies.

- **Batch Efficiency**: Processing transactions in batches is more efficient than handling them individually and provides better opportunities for validation and consensus.

- **Predictable Timing**: Users and applications can understand approximately when their transactions will be processed based on epoch timing.

## Governance and Elections

The sequencer network operates under distributed governance that manages participation and network parameters.

### Election Cycles

- **Regular Elections**: The system includes regular election cycles every N hours, where N is configurable through DAO voting. This ensures that sequencer participation remains current and responsive to network needs.

- **Performance Monitoring**: During election cycles, sequencer performance is evaluated based on reliability, accuracy, and participation in consensus.

- **Dynamic Participation**: The election system allows for adding new groups and removing underperforming ones based on community governance decisions.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Executor Mechanism

TAC employs a separation of responsibilities between cross-chain message sequencing and execution, with designated executors handling the final transaction processing.

### Executor Selection and Assignment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Permissionless Participation" icon="unlock">
    **Open executor network:** - Any participant can become an executor without
    central approval - No collateral requirements for executors (security
    through cryptographic proofs) - Executors compete for transaction processing
    opportunities - Selection based on assignment specified in cross-chain
    messages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Assignment Mechanism" icon="target">
    **Message-specific executor designation:** - Each cross-chain message
    specifies which executor is authorized to process it - For round-trip
    operations (TON → TAC → TON), two executors must be specified -
    CrossChainLayer contract verifies executor authorization before execution -
    Only designated executor can claim rewards for processing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Executor Responsibilities

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Message Execution">
    **Primary execution duties:** - Submit finalized message batches with Merkle
    proofs to CrossChainLayer contract - Verify cryptographic proofs of
    consensus approval - Trigger asset minting/unlocking operations before
    contract calls - Execute target smart contract methods with validated
    parameters
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Fee Management">
    **Reward collection and verification:** - Estimate gas usage before
    execution using Merkle proofs - Verify attached fees cover execution costs
    (gas + overhead) - Collect executor fees upon successful transaction
    completion - Optional subsidization of small fee deficits for UX
    preservation
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Oracle Services">
    **Future enhancement capabilities:** - Provide oracle data during message
    execution (planned feature) - Access to up-to-date market data and external
    information - Enhanced execution context for complex cross-chain operations
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Security Through Cryptography

**No Collateral Required:**

- Executor security guaranteed through cryptographic proofs rather than economic staking
- Merkle proofs ensure only consensus-approved messages can be executed
- CrossChainLayer contract validates all proofs before allowing execution
- Eliminates need for executor collateral or centralized approval processes

## Future Evolution

The modular design of the sequencer network allows for future improvements and adaptations as the network grows and requirements evolve.

### Planned Enhancements

- **FROST Consensus Upgrade**: Migration to FROST-Ed25519 threshold signatures with DKG
- **Enhanced Oracle Integration**: Expanded oracle services during execution
- **Scalability Improvements**: Support for more groups, shorter epochs, efficient consensus
- **Additional Blockchain Support**: Potential expansion beyond TON and TAC EVM
