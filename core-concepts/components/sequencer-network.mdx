title: Sequencer Network
description: "The decentralized network of nodes that validates and processes cross-chain messages through consensus"
---

The Sequencer Network is the operational backbone of the TON Adapter, consisting of decentralized nodes that collect, validate, and reach consensus on cross-chain messages. These sequencers ensure that messages between TON and TAC EVM are processed securely and reliably through a multi-layered validation system.

## Core Functions

Sequencers perform several critical functions that enable secure cross-chain communication:

- **Transaction Collection**: Sequencers continuously monitor both TON and TAC EVM chains for relevant events. When users initiate cross-chain operations, sequencers detect these events and store them in local databases for processing.

- **Data Validation**: Before participating in consensus, each sequencer validates transaction data locally. This includes verifying that asset transfers match message parameters and ensuring users have sufficient balances for requested operations.

- **Merkle Tree Formation**: At regular intervals determined by network parameters, sequencers compile validated transactions into Merkle trees. These trees provide cryptographic proof of transaction inclusion and enable efficient consensus.

- **Consensus Participation**: Sequencers work together in groups to reach agreement on transaction validity, with each group requiring 66% internal consensus before submitting to the broader network.

## Sequencer Groups

The network organizes individual sequencers into groups to enhance security through redundancy and distributed validation.

### Group Formation and Management

- **Approval Process**: Sequencer groups are not permissionless - they require approval through DAO voting or multisig processes. This ensures that only trusted entities with proper infrastructure and incentives can participate in securing cross-chain messages.

- **Group Composition**: Each group contains multiple sequencer nodes owned by a specific entity. This could be a trusted dApp, infrastructure provider, or other stakeholder with strong incentives to maintain network security.

- **Internal Operations**: Within each group, sequencers operate independently but must coordinate to reach consensus. This internal redundancy protects against individual node failures while maintaining group-level reliability.

### Economic Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Collateral Staking" icon="coins">
    Each sequencer group must maintain collateral above a minimum threshold set
    by DAO governance. While the collateral amount doesn't affect voting power
    within the consensus mechanism, it directly impacts profitability and
    provides economic security. 
    
    Groups with higher collateral demonstrate stronger commitment to network security and receive proportionally higher rewards for their participation.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Stake Management" icon="chart-line">
  Groups can modify their collateral when changing proofs, but there are
  protections in place to prevent abuse. If an incorrect proof is submitted,
  there's a time window for other groups to issue penalties before collateral
  can be withdrawn. This system ensures that groups maintain skin in the game
  throughout their participation in the network.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Profitability Incentives" icon="trending-up">
    Higher collateral amounts lead to increased profitability, creating natural
    incentives for groups to stake substantial amounts. 
    
    This aligns economic incentives with network security requirements.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Consensus Mechanism

The sequencer network achieves consensus through a multi-layer validation process that ensures security while maintaining operational efficiency.

### Group-Level Consensus

- **Internal Agreement**: Within each group, sequencers must reach 66% agreement before the group can submit its Merkle tree to the network. This high threshold ensures that temporary node issues or minor disagreements don't prevent group participation.

- **Signature Collection**: As group members submit matching root hashes to the SequencerGroup smart contract, the signature counter increases. Only when signatures reach the required threshold does the tree advance to network-level consideration.

- **Validation Requirements**: The SequencerGroup contract verifies that submitting wallets have proper authorization before accepting their signatures, preventing unauthorized participation.

### Network-Level Consensus

- **Cross-Group Validation**: For a Merkle tree to be accepted by the network, multiple independent groups must submit identical trees. This requirement prevents any single group from manipulating the message flow or processing incorrect transactions.

- **Consensus Threshold**: The network requires agreement from enough groups to ensure security. This threshold is configurable through DAO governance to balance security requirements with operational efficiency.

- **Tree Application**: Only when sufficient groups submit matching trees does the CrossChainLayer smart contract accept the tree for transaction execution.

## Transaction Processing Flow

  <Step title="Event Detection" icon="radar">
    Sequencers monitor both TON and TAC EVM chains for cross-chain events. When
    a user initiates a transaction, multiple sequencers detect it simultaneously
    and begin validation processes.

<Step title="Local Validation" icon="shield-check">
  Each sequencer validates the transaction locally, checking asset transfers,

## Economic Security Model

The sequencer network's security relies on economic incentives that align participant behavior with network health.

### Reward Structure

- **Stake-Based Selection**: Executors are chosen for specific transactions based on their collateral amounts. Higher stake increases the probability of selection and larger potential rewards.

- **Proportional Distribution**: At the end of each execution round, rewards are distributed proportionally to sequencer stakes, regardless of who actually performed the execution.

- **Performance Incentives**: This system incentivizes sequencers to maintain higher collateral commitments while ensuring rewards are fairly distributed based on economic contribution.

### Penalty Mechanisms

<Warning>
  The network includes robust penalty systems to discourage malicious behavior
  and maintain security standards.
</Warning>

- **Penalty Applications**: Other sequencer groups can submit penalty applications to the Penalty smart contract when they detect incorrect behavior or invalid proofs.

- **Collateral Locking**: If enough groups agree on a penalty application, partial collateral locking occurs while the penalty is investigated and resolved.

- **Network Voting**: Penalty resolution happens through network-wide voting, ensuring that punishments are applied fairly and only when warranted.

## Epoch-Based Processing

The sequencer network operates on an epoch-based system that provides structure and predictability to cross-chain message processing.

### Epoch Structure

- **Time-Based Windows**: Each epoch represents a specific time period during which transactions are collected and processed together. The epoch duration is configurable through DAO governance.

- **Deterministic Timing**: Epoch boundaries are calculated using the formula:

```
EpochId = (currentTime - protocolDeployTime) / epochDuration
```

- **Processing Boundaries**: Transactions are processed within specific timeframes:

```
[protocolDeployTime + EpochId × epochDuration,
 protocolDeployTime + (EpochId + 1) × epochDuration]
```

### Benefits of Epoch Processing

- **Ordered Processing**: The epoch system ensures that all sequencers work with the same set of transactions, preventing timing-based attacks and inconsistencies.

- **Batch Efficiency**: Processing transactions in batches is more efficient than handling them individually and provides better opportunities for validation and consensus.

- **Predictable Timing**: Users and applications can understand approximately when their transactions will be processed based on epoch timing.

## Governance and Elections

The sequencer network operates under decentralized governance that manages participation and network parameters.

### Election Cycles

- **Regular Elections**: The system includes regular election cycles every N hours, where N is configurable through DAO voting. This ensures that sequencer participation remains current and responsive to network needs.

- **Performance Monitoring**: During election cycles, sequencer performance is evaluated based on reliability, accuracy, and participation in consensus.

- **Dynamic Participation**: The election system allows for adding new groups and removing underperforming ones based on community governance decisions.
