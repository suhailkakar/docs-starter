    alt="Different token types in the TAC ecosystem"
  />
</Frame>

### TON-Origin Tokens

- **TON Jettons**: Standard fungible tokens native to the TON blockchain that follow TON's jetton standard with typical 9-decimal precision.

- **Native TON**: The native currency of the TON blockchain, which receives special handling when bridging to maintain its fundamental properties.

- **TON-Native Assets**: Specialized tokens created specifically for the TON ecosystem, including governance tokens, utility tokens, and application-specific assets.

### TAC EVM-Origin Tokens

- **Native TAC Tokens**: Tokens originally created on the TAC EVM Layer, including the native TAC token used for gas fees and protocol operations.

- **EVM dApp Tokens**: Tokens created by applications deployed on TAC EVM, such as liquidity provider tokens, governance tokens, and application-specific assets.

- **Wrapped Assets**: Representations of external assets that have been brought into the TAC EVM ecosystem through various bridging mechanisms.

## Token Deployment Process

When tokens first cross between chains, TAC automatically handles the deployment of corresponding token contracts with proper metadata preservation.

### Automatic Deployment Triggers

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Bridge Detection" icon="radar">
    When a token type first appears in a cross-chain message, the sequencer
    network detects that no corresponding contract exists on the target chain.
  </Step>

<Step title="Metadata Extraction" icon="info">
  The system extracts essential token information including name, symbol,
  decimals, description, and original contract address from the source chain.
</Step>

<Step title="Contract Deployment" icon="rocket">
  A standard ERC-20 (for TAC EVM) or jetton (for TON) contract is automatically
  deployed using the TokenFactory with the extracted metadata.
</Step>

  <Step title="Registry Update" icon="book">
    The new token deployment is registered in the cross-chain address registry,
    creating a permanent mapping between chain-specific addresses.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Token Implementation Standards

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="ERC-20 on TAC EVM">
    - **Standard Compliance**: All bridged tokens on TAC EVM implement the standard ERC-20 interface for maximum compatibility with existing tools and protocols.
    
    - **Metadata Extensions**: Additional metadata fields are included to maintain connection with the original TON token, including the `l1Address` field containing the original TON jetton address.
    
    - **Decimal Preservation**: TON tokens maintain their original 9-decimal precision when deployed on TAC EVM, rather than being converted to the typical 18-decimal EVM standard.
    
      ```solidity
      interface IERC20Extended {
          // Standard ERC-20 functions
          function name() external view returns (string memory);
          function symbol() external view returns (string memory);
          function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
          
          // TAC-specific metadata
          function l1Address() external view returns (string memory);
          function description() external view returns (string memory);
          function image() external view returns (string memory);
      }
      ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Jettons on TON">
    - **TON Standard Compliance**: Tokens bridged to TON follow the standard jetton implementation for compatibility with TON wallets and applications.
    
    - **Metadata Preservation**: Original EVM token metadata is preserved in the TON jetton implementation, including name, symbol, and decimal information.
    
    - **Decimal Limitations**: EVM tokens with 18 decimals face limitations when bridging to TON due to TON's 9-decimal standard, potentially requiring precision adjustments.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Asset Synchronization

The synchronization process ensures that token representations remain consistent across both chains while maintaining proper supply accounting.

### TON to TAC EVM Synchronization

- **Automatic Trigger**: When users attempt to execute transactions involving TON-native tokens, sequencers automatically create wrapped versions on TAC EVM if they don't already exist.

- **Token Creation Operation**: The sequencer creates a token deployment operation that includes all necessary metadata and deployment parameters.

- **Verification Process**: The token's existence and metadata are verified on the TON blockchain before creating the corresponding EVM representation.

- **Address Calculation**: The corresponding TAC EVM address is calculated deterministically based on the TON token's metadata and address.

### TAC EVM to TON Synchronization

- **Burn Operation Detection**: When EVM tokens are burned for bridging to TON, the system detects whether a corresponding jetton exists on TON.

- **StateInit Inclusion**: If no corresponding jetton exists, the bridging message includes StateInit data for automatic token deployment on TON.

- **Metadata Verification**: Token metadata is verified on TAC EVM and used to create the appropriate jetton implementation on TON.

## Decimal Management

Different blockchain ecosystems use different decimal standards, requiring careful handling to maintain precision and user experience.

<Accordion title="Decimal Standards and Compatibility" icon="calculator">
- **TON Standard**: TON jettons typically use 9 decimals, following the platform's conventions for token precision and gas efficiency.

- **EVM Standard**: Ethereum and EVM chains commonly use 18 decimals, providing higher precision for complex DeFi operations and calculations.

- **Preservation Strategy**: TAC maintains the original decimal precision of tokens when bridging, rather than converting to the target chain's standard.

- **Compatibility Considerations**: While TAC EVM supports tokens with various decimal counts, applications must handle the precision differences appropriately.

</Accordion>

<Warning>
  Bridging 18-decimal TAC tokens back to TON may have limitations due to TON's
  9-decimal standard. Consider keeping high-precision tokens on the EVM side
  when possible.
</Warning>

## Address Calculation and Pairing

Token address relationships follow deterministic patterns that enable predictable bridging behavior and address pre-calculation.

### Deterministic Address Generation

- **TVM-Origin Tokens**: For tokens originating from TON, the corresponding TAC EVM address is calculated based on the token's TON metadata and contract address.

- **EVM-Origin Tokens**: For tokens originating from TAC EVM, the corresponding TON jetton address is calculated using the token's EVM metadata and deployment parameters.

- **Pre-Calculation Capability**: Applications can calculate paired token addresses before tokens actually bridge, enabling advanced features and user interface improvements.

### Address Registry System

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Registry Functions" icon="database">
    - **Mapping Storage**: The system maintains an on-chain registry of all token address pairs, providing an authoritative source for cross-chain address relationships.
    - **Query Interface**: Applications can query the registry to find corresponding addresses without needing to perform calculations or wait for token deployment.
    - **Metadata Access**: The registry also stores essential token metadata for proper display and interaction across both chains.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Registry Updates" icon="refresh-cw">
    - **Automatic Registration**: When tokens are first deployed through bridging operations, they're automatically registered with their cross-chain counterparts.
    - **Verification Process**: Registry updates are validated through the same consensus mechanisms as other cross-chain operations.
    - **Immutable Records**: Once registered, address pairs become immutable to prevent confusion and maintain consistency.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Liquidity Management

Token operations enable sophisticated liquidity management strategies that benefit both TON and TAC EVM ecosystems.

### Cross-Chain Liquidity Flow

- **Dynamic Allocation**: Tokens can flow between chains based on where liquidity is most needed, optimizing capital efficiency across both ecosystems.

- **Arbitrage Mechanisms**: Price differences between chains create natural arbitrage opportunities that help maintain price consistency and efficient markets.

- **Protocol Integration**: DeFi protocols can access liquidity from both ecosystems, increasing available capital and reducing slippage for users.

### Liquidity Pool Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="DEX Liquidity">
    - **Unified Pools**: When users provide liquidity to DEXes on TAC EVM using TON-origin tokens, the system handles two separate transactions for TVM tokens that are combined into a single Merkle message.
    - **LP Token Creation**: DEX pools create liquidity provider tokens that can be bridged back to TON for use in TON-native applications.
    - **Cross-Chain Trading**: The same liquidity serves traders from both ecosystems, maximizing utilization and fee generation for liquidity providers.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Lending Protocols">
    - **Collateral Management**: TON tokens can serve as collateral in TAC EVM lending protocols, while borrowed assets can be used across both chains.
    - **Interest Optimization**: Users can move assets to the chain offering the best interest rates or borrowing terms.
    - **Risk Distribution**: Cross-chain lending enables better risk distribution and capital efficiency.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Token Lifecycle Management

### Creation and Minting

- **Initial Deployment**: New tokens can be created on either chain and automatically gain the ability to bridge to the other chain when first used in cross-chain operations.

- **Supply Management**: Token creators maintain control over supply on the origin chain, while bridged representations have supplies managed automatically by the bridging system.

- **Metadata Updates**: While metadata can be modified on the origin chain, changes are not currently reflected in bridged representations, maintaining stability of deployed contracts.

### Transfer and Trading

- **Native Transfers**: Tokens can be transferred normally within their native chains using standard blockchain mechanisms.

- **Cross-Chain Movement**: Token movement between chains occurs through the asset bridging system as part of application interactions.

*- *Trading Integration\*\*: Bridged tokens integrate seamlessly with existing trading infrastructure on both chains.

### Burning and Recovery

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Controlled Burning" icon="flame">
    - **Bridge Burning**: Tokens are burned automatically as part of the bridging process when moving from TAC EVM back to TON.
    - **Supply Reduction**: Token creators can implement burning mechanisms on their native chains to reduce total supply.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Asset Recovery" icon="shield">
