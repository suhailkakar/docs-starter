title: TAC Tokenomics
description: "The native utility token of TAC network with gas, staking, and governance functions"
---

TAC is the native utility token of the TAC network, playing a central role in execution, consensus, and governance processes. Implemented as an ERC-20 asset on the TAC EVM Layer, it is used across all layers of the protocol and provides fundamental value through multiple utility pillars.

## TAC Token Role in Protocol

The TAC token serves three critical functions that reinforce its fundamental value while enabling seamless user experience:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Gas Token">
    **Primary execution currency for TAC EVM Layer** - Every EVM transaction
    ultimately consumes TAC tokens - Network-level paymaster automatically
    converts TON fees to TAC for TON-originating transactions - EIP-1559
    compatible gas pricing with base fees and priority fees - Predictable
    transaction costs with automatic fee adjustment
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Staking & Security">
    **Economic security backbone of the network** - TAC tokens staked by
    validators securing the TAC EVM Layer - Staked TAC backs network security
    through economic incentives - Subject to slashing for malicious validator
    behavior - Delegation system allows broader participation in network
    security
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Governance Token">
    **Democratic protocol management** - Staked TAC grants voting rights in
    protocol DAO - Governs protocol upgrades and system-wide configurations -
    Controls consensus parameters and security thresholds - Manages economic
    parameters like inflation and staking rewards
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Supply and Emission Model

### Initial Token Distribution

<Accordion title="Token Generation Event" icon="rocket">
**Initial Supply**: 10,000,000,000 TAC minted at Token Generation Event

The total initial supply provides sufficient liquidity for network operations while maintaining scarcity for value accrual. Distribution includes allocations for:

- Network validators and early security providers
- Ecosystem development and grant programs
- Team and advisor allocations with multi-year vesting
- Community treasury for governance-directed initiatives

</Accordion>

### Inflation and Validator Rewards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Inflation Parameters" icon="trending-up">
    **Maximum Inflation Rate**: 3-5% annually - **Parametric Function**: Linear
    function peaking at goal_bonded staking rate - **Dynamic Adjustment**:
    Inflation rate adjusts based on actual staking participation - **Below Goal
    Staking**: Lower inflation when staking rate is below target - **Above Goal
    Staking**: Reduced inflation when staking exceeds target - **Purpose**:
    Motivates optimal staking levels for network security
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validator Incentives" icon="shield">
    **Staking Rewards Distribution** - Inflation funds validator rewards to
    motivate network security - Proportional distribution based on validator
    stake and performance - Commission structure allows validators to share
    rewards with delegators - Slashing penalties for provable malicious behavior
    - Additional rewards from transaction fees and MEV
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Vesting and Long-term Alignment

**Multi-year Linear Vesting Schedules**

- Team and investor allocations distributed over extended periods
- Ecosystem incentives released based on milestone achievements
- Long-term alignment ensures committed participation in network growth
- Transparent vesting schedules publicly verifiable on-chain

## Fee Structure and Token Utility

### Directional Fee Model

TAC implements a directional, EIP-1559-compatible fee system that simplifies user experience while ensuring proper protocol-level accounting:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="TON → TAC Operations" icon="arrow-right">
    **All fees paid in TON tokens** - Users pay fees in familiar TON
    denomination - Network paymaster converts TON to TAC automatically - No need
    for users to hold TAC directly - Seamless single-token experience
  </Card>

  <Card title="TAC → TON Operations" icon="arrow-left">
    **Fees paid in TAC tokens** - Native TAC payments for TAC-originated
    transactions - Direct fee payment without conversion overhead - Standard EVM
    gas model with TAC denomination
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Fee Components

Each cross-chain message includes two distinct fee components:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sequencer Fee" icon="users">
    **Fixed protocol fee for consensus services** - Fixed amount set in protocol
    parameters - Distributed among sequencers proportionally to their stake -
    Rewards sequencers for validation and consensus participation - Predictable
    cost component for users
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Executor Fee" icon="play">
    **Dynamic fee for execution services** - Remaining amount after sequencer
    fee deduction (totalFee - sequencerFee) - Covers gas costs on destination
    chain - Compensates executor for processing overhead - Variable based on
    network conditions and complexity
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Token Economics and Value Accrual

### Standard Layer 1 Value Mechanisms

TAC follows proven Layer 1 tokenomics patterns that create sustainable value accrual:

- **Gas Consumption**: All network activity requires TAC tokens for execution
- **Staking Demand**: Security requirements drive token locking and reduced circulating supply
- **Governance Value**: Protocol control rights increase with network adoption
- **Fee Burning**: Portion of transaction fees removed from circulation (EIP-1559 mechanism)

### Economic Alignment with TON

**Symbiotic Growth Model**

- TAC's success directly benefits TON ecosystem through increased utility
- TON's massive user base drives TAC network activity and demand
- Cross-chain liquidity flows benefit both token ecosystems
- Hybrid dApps create sustainable demand for both TON and TAC tokens

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Token Utility Expansions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cross-Chain Governance">
    **Extended governance capabilities** - TAC governance participation from TON
    wallets - Cross-chain proposal voting and execution - Unified governance
    experience across both ecosystems
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Enhanced Staking">
    **Additional staking mechanisms** - Babylon Bitcoin restaking integration
    for enhanced security - Liquid staking derivatives for improved capital
    efficiency - Cross-chain staking rewards and delegation
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Ecosystem Incentives">
    **Developer and user incentive programs** - Grant programs for hybrid dApp
    development - User incentives for cross-chain activity - Liquidity mining
    and yield farming opportunities
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Understanding TAC tokenomics provides the foundation for exploring how the token integrates with TAC's governance and operational systems.
