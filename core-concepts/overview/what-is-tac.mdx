title: What is TAC
description: "TAC bridges TON's 1 billion users with EVM's application ecosystem"
---

TAC is an **EVM for Telegram**: a Layer 1 with a TON-specific CrossChain Layer that connects Ethereum dApps and developers with Telegram's users without exposing users to bridges, extra wallets, or wrapped assets. TAC eliminates the gap between TON's billion-user reach and EVM's programmability through **Hybrid dApps** - EVM dApps natively accessible by any TON wallet holder.

## The Problem TAC Solves

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="For EVM Developers" icon="code">
  <br/>
    **Challenge**: Reaching TON's billion users requires rebuilding entire
    applications in FunC, TON's native language. <br /><br />
    
    **TAC Solution**: Deploy
    existing Solidity contracts as-is and make them accessible to TON users
  </Card>

  <Card title="For TON Users" icon="users">
  <br/>
    **Challenge**: Limited access to DeFi, gaming, and other EVM applications
    that dominate the blockchain space. <br /><br />
    **TAC Solution**: Use any EVM application directly from TON wallets without bridges or multiple wallets
  </Card>

## How TAC Works

TAC operates through three core innovations that work together seamlessly:

<Accordion title="Layer 1 EVM Blockchain" >
TAC EVM Layer is a CosmosSDK-based blockchain that runs unmodified Solidity contracts and achieves **≈2-second finality** through dPoS. This means:

- Deploy existing Solidity contracts without modifications
- Use familiar tools like Hardhat, Remix, and MetaMask  
- Built on proven Cosmos SDK with Tendermint consensus
- Secured by delegated Proof of Stake with economic incentives
- **Future Enhancement**: Babylon Bitcoin restaking for additional economic security

The EVM layer handles all application logic and state, while the TON Adapter manages cross-chain communication.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="TON Adapter" >
A distributed network of **sequencers** that securely routes messages between TON and TAC EVM:

- **Validation**: Sequencers verify all transactions and asset transfers
- **Consensus**: 3/5 sequencer consensus with BFT guarantees
- **Security**: Multiple validation layers prevent double-spending and fraud
- **Epochs**: Time-based processing ensures orderly message handling

<Info>
  **Current Network Status**: The sequencer network is currently distributed but not decentralized. Full decentralization is on the roadmap as the network matures.
</Info>

This isn't a traditional bridge — it's a purpose-built messaging system designed for hybrid applications.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Proxy Smart Contracts">
Specialized contracts that make cross-chain interaction feel native:

**On TON**: SDK handles proxy logic automatically  
**On EVM**: Solidity contracts receive and process cross-chain messages

When a TON user interacts with an EVM app, proxy contracts handle all the complex routing, asset management, and message formatting behind the scenes.

</Accordion>

  - **No bridges**: Assets move automatically behind the scenes
  - **Familiar UX**: Apps feel native to TON environment
  - **Telegram integration**: Access apps directly through Telegram Mini Apps

  <Check>
    TON users get access to DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and more without learning new workflows
  </Check>
</Tab>

  <Tab title="For Ecosystem">
    ### Unified Liquidity - **Cross-chain composability**: 
    
    TON and EVM applications can interact 
    - **Shared liquidity**: Tokens flow freely between ecosystems 
    - **Network effects**: More users attract more developers and vice versa 
    - **Innovation acceleration**: Best of both worlds drives faster development
  </Tab>

## Transaction Flow Example

Here's what happens when a TON user swaps tokens on an EVM DEX through TAC's hybrid dApp system:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Action" icon="user">
    User opens a DEX interface and connects their TON wallet. They select tokens
    to swap and approve the transaction.
  </Step>

<Step title="Proxy Processing" icon="network">
  The TON proxy locks user assets and creates a formatted message containing
  swap parameters and destination details.
</Step>

<Step title="Sequencer Validation" icon="shield-check">
  Sequencer network validates the transaction, forms Merkle trees, and reaches
  consensus across multiple groups.
</Step>

<Step title="Executor Selection & EVM Execution" icon="play">
  A designated executor submits Merkle proofs to TAC EVM Layer, triggers asset
  minting/unlocking, and executes the swap on the target DEX contract via proxy.
</Step>

  <Step title="Result Delivery" icon="check">
    Swap completes and new tokens are sent back to the user's TON wallet through
    the same secure process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Makes TAC Different

<Warning>
  TAC is not a cross-chain workaround—it is a native execution path between
  two ecosystems that were never meant to connect. By removing barriers instead
  of building over them, TAC aligns UX, liquidity, and developer incentives.
</Warning>

Unlike traditional bridges that move assets between existing chains, TAC creates **hybrid applications** that natively serve both ecosystems. Users don't "bridge to another chain"—they use applications that happen to run on EVM but feel completely native to TON.

This fundamental difference enables:

- **Seamless UX**: No wallet switching or manual bridging
- **Unified liquidity**: Assets flow where they're needed most
- **Developer efficiency**: Build once, serve both ecosystems
- **Network effects**: Growth in one ecosystem benefits the other
