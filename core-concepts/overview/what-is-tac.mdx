title: What is TAC
description: "TAC bridges TON's 1 billion users with EVM's application ecosystem"
---

TAC is a **Layer 1 blockchain** and a **Network Extension** that connects TON's massive user base with Ethereum's rich application ecosystem. It solves a fundamental problem: EVM developers can't easily reach TON's 1 billion Telegram users, and TON users can't access the vast world of EVM applications.

## The Problem TAC Solves

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="For EVM Developers" icon="code">
  <br/>
    **Challenge**: Reaching TON's billion users requires rebuilding entire
    applications in FunC, TON's native language. <br /><br />
    
    **TAC Solution**: Deploy
    existing Solidity contracts as-is and make them accessible to TON users
  </Card>

  <Card title="For TON Users" icon="users">
  <br/>
    **Challenge**: Limited access to DeFi, gaming, and other EVM applications
    that dominate the blockchain space. <br /><br />
    **TAC Solution**: Use any EVM application directly from TON wallets without bridges or multiple wallets

## How TAC Works

TAC operates through three core innovations that work together seamlessly:

<Accordion title="Layer 1 EVM Blockchain" >
TAC runs a full Layer 1 blockchain built on **Cosmos SDK**, providing complete EVM compatibility. This means:

- Deploy existing Solidity contracts without modifications
- Use familiar tools like Hardhat, Remix, and MetaMask
- Benefit from 3-second block times and same-block finality
- Secured by delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS) and **Babylon Bitcoin Staking**

The EVM layer handles all application logic and state, while the TON Adapter manages cross-chain communication.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="TON Adapter" >
A decentralized network of **sequencers** that securely routes messages between TON and TAC EVM:

- **Validation**: Sequencers verify all transactions and asset transfers
- **Consensus**: Groups require 66% agreement before proceeding
- **Security**: Multiple validation layers prevent double-spending and fraud
- **Epochs**: Time-based processing ensures orderly message handling

This isn't a traditional bridge — it's a purpose-built messaging system designed for hybrid applications.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Proxy Smart Contracts">
Specialized contracts that make cross-chain interaction feel native:

**On TON**: SDK handles proxy logic automatically  
**On EVM**: Solidity contracts receive and process cross-chain messages

When a TON user interacts with an EVM app, proxy contracts handle all the complex routing, asset management, and message formatting behind the scenes.

</Accordion>

## Key Benefits

    ### Deploy Once, Reach Billions - **No code rewrites**: 
    
    Deploy existing Solidity contracts directly
    - **Familiar tooling**: Use Hardhat, Truffle,
    Remix, and other EVM tools 
    - **Automatic proxies**: TAC generates proxy contracts for you 
    - **Cross-chain SDK**: Simple JavaScript library handles TON integration
    <Tip>EVM developers can expand to TON's ecosystem in days, not months</Tip>
  </Tab>

<Tab title="For Users">
  ### Native TON Experience
  - **One wallet**: Use your TON wallet for everything
  - **No bridges**: Assets move automatically behind the scenes
  - **Familiar UX**: Apps feel native to TON environment
  - **Telegram integration**: Access apps directly through Telegram Mini Apps

  <Check>
    TON users get access to DeFi, gaming, NFTs, and more without learning new workflows
  </Check>
</Tab>

  <Tab title="For Ecosystem">
    ### Unified Liquidity - **Cross-chain composability**: 
    
    TON and EVM applications can interact 
    - **Shared liquidity**: Tokens flow freely between ecosystems 
    - **Network effects**: More users attract more developers and vice versa 
    - **Innovation acceleration**: Best of both worlds drives faster development
  </Tab>

## Transaction Flow Example

Here's what happens when a TON user swaps tokens on an EVM DEX:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Action" icon="user">
    User opens a DEX interface and connects their TON wallet. They select tokens
    to swap and approve the transaction.
  </Step>

<Step title="Proxy Processing" icon="network">
  The TON proxy locks user assets and creates a formatted message containing
  swap parameters and destination details.
</Step>

<Step title="Sequencer Validation" icon="shield-check">
  Sequencer network validates the transaction, forms Merkle trees, and reaches
  consensus across multiple groups.
</Step>

<Step title="EVM Execution" icon="play">
  The EVM proxy receives the validated message, mints wrapped tokens, and
  executes the swap on the target DEX contract.
</Step>

  <Step title="Result Delivery" icon="check">
    Swap completes and new tokens are sent back to the user's TON wallet through
    the same secure process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Makes TAC Different

<Warning>
  TAC isn't just another bridge or Layer 2. It's a purpose-built Layer 1
  designed specifically to unify TON and EVM ecosystems.
</Warning>

Unlike traditional bridges that move assets between existing chains, TAC creates **hybrid applications** that natively serve both ecosystems. Users don't "bridge to another chain"—they use applications that happen to run on EVM but feel completely native to TON.

This fundamental difference enables:

- **Seamless UX**: No wallet switching or manual bridging
- **Unified liquidity**: Assets flow where they're needed most
- **Developer efficiency**: Build once, serve both ecosystems
- **Network effects**: Growth in one ecosystem benefits the other
