## Multi-Layer Security Architecture

TAC's security model operates across multiple layers to provide comprehensive protection for users and applications.

### EVM Layer Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cancun Network Foundation" icon="ethereum">

    **Modern EVM Implementation**: TAC EVM is based on the Cancun upgrade,
    incorporating the latest Ethereum security improvements and optimizations.

    **Proven Technology**: Built on battle-tested EVM specifications with all
    security features and protections of modern Ethereum networks.

     **Standard Compliance**: Full compatibility with Ethereum security models ensures
    familiar security guarantees for developers.

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS)" icon="coins">

**TAC Token Security**: Network consensus secured by delegated Proof of Stake
using $TAC tokens as the staking mechanism.

**Validator Incentives**: Economic incentives align validator behavior with network security through staking
rewards and slashing penalties.

**Distributed Validation**: Multiple independent validators secure the network through distributed consensus
mechanisms.

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Babylon Integration" icon="bitcoin">

    **Enhanced Economic Security**: Integration with Babylon protocol adds
    Bitcoin's economic security to TAC's consensus layer.

    **Bitcoin Staking**: Bitcoin holders can stake their BTC to provide additional economic security
    for TAC network operations.

    **Dual Security Model**: Combines dPoS consensus with Bitcoin's proven security model for enhanced protection.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### TON Adapter Security

The TON Adapter implements distributed architecture with multiple validation layers:

<Info>
  **Current Network Status**: The sequencer network is currently distributed but not decentralized. Full decentralization is on the roadmap as the network matures.
</Info>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Distributed Architecture">
  
    **Current State**: TON Adapter operates with distributed sequencer groups
    providing redundancy and security validation. 
    
    **Multiple Validators**: Multiple independent sequencer groups validate cross-chain transactions
    through consensus mechanisms. 
    
    **Future Decentralization**: Architecture designed for progressive decentralization as the network matures.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Consensus Protection">

    **Multi-Group Validation**: Cross-chain messages require consensus from
    multiple independent sequencer groups.

    **Economic Stakes**: Sequencers stake collateral to participate in validation, creating financial incentives for
    honest behavior.

    **Cryptographic Proofs**: All cross-chain operations protected by Merkle proofs and cryptographic verification.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Professional Security Auditing

TAC undergoes comprehensive security audits by industry-leading firms to ensure the highest security standards.

### Additional Security Reviews

**Quantstamp (Proxy Apps)**: Smart contract audits for proxy applications ensuring secure cross-chain contract interactions and asset management.

**Ongoing Reviews**: Regular security assessments and code reviews as the protocol evolves and new features are added.

## Continuous Security Monitoring

TAC implements 24/7 security monitoring and incident response capabilities to detect and respond to potential threats.

### Real-Time Threat Detection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hypernative Monitoring" icon="radar">

    **24/7 Security Monitoring**: Hypernative provides continuous monitoring of
    TAC networks, detecting potential exploits and anomalous behavior.

    **Mempool-Level Detection**: Advanced monitoring capabilities detect
    suspicious transactions at the mempool level before they're executed.

    **Real-Time Alerts**: Immediate notifications for potential security threats
    enable rapid response and mitigation.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dedicated SOC Team" icon="users">

    **24/7 Security Operations**: Fully dedicated Security Operations Center
    (SOC) team monitoring TAC infrastructure around the clock.

    **Incident Response**: Trained security professionals ready to respond to any security
    incidents or threats.

    **Proactive Monitoring**: Continuous analysis of network activity and security metrics to identify potential issues before
    they become problems.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Future Security Enhancements

TAC has planned significant security upgrades that will provide additional layers of protection and decentralization.

### Babylon Bitcoin Restaking Integration

TAC plans integration with Babylon's Bitcoin restaking protocol to add massive economic security:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bitcoin as External Security Layer" icon="bitcoin">
    **Leveraging Bitcoin's Economic Strength:**
    
    - Bitcoin holders delegate BTC stakes to Babylon validators
    - Validators cryptographically verify TAC EVM blocks and Merkle roots
    - Self-custodial delegation maintains decentralization without custody risk
    - Exponentially increases attack costs through Bitcoin's security budget
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Slashing for Equivocation" icon="shield-alert">
    **Economic Penalties for Malicious Behavior:**
    
    - Validators providing conflicting signatures face automatic slashing
    - Double-signing detection through Babylon protocol mechanisms
    - Direct economic penalties via Bitcoin blockchain enforcement
    - Makes attacks economically irrational at Bitcoin-scale security
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### FROST Consensus Upgrade

**Planned migration to FROST-Ed25519 threshold signatures with Distributed Key Generation (DKG):**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Threshold Security">
    **Enhanced Cryptographic Security:**
    
    - Threshold signature creation requires t+1 out of n participants
    - Attackers controlling up to t participants cannot forge signatures
    - Ed25519 compatibility with existing verification systems
    - Round-optimized design minimizes communication overhead
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Distributed Key Generation">
