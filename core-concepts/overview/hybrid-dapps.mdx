title: Hybrid dApps
description: "Applications that combine EVM smart contract logic with native TON user experience through TAC"
---

Hybrid dApps are applications that run their core logic on TAC's EVM Layer while providing a completely native experience for TON users. Unlike traditional cross-chain applications that require users to switch networks or manage multiple wallets, hybrid dApps feel like native TON applications while leveraging the full power of EVM's mature ecosystem.

## What Makes an App "Hybrid"

Traditional dApps exist entirely within one ecosystem. Hybrid dApps span two ecosystems seamlessly:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Backend (EVM Side)" icon="blocks">
    - Solidity contracts on TAC EVM Layer
    - Complex DeFi primitives and composability
    - Mature tooling and battle-tested code
    - Rich ecosystem of integrations

  </Card>

  <Card title="Frontend (TON Side)" icon="laptop">
    - TON wallet integration
    - Telegram Mini App interface
    - Native asset handling
    - Familiar TON user flows

  </Card>
</Columns>

<Note>
  Users interact with hybrid dApps exactly like they would with native TON apps,
  they never know there's EVM logic running behind the scenes.
</Note>

## The Hybrid dApp Advantage

Hybrid dApps unlock a new paradigm where users and developers enjoy the strengths of both TON and EVM ecosystems—without compromise.

## Development Patterns

Hybrid dApps on TAC are designed to feel native to both TON and EVM users, blending familiar interfaces with powerful cross-chain capabilities.

By leveraging TAC's architecture, developers can build applications that seamlessly connect users, assets, and protocols across ecosystems—without compromising on user experience or security. Below are the key patterns and best practices for building truly hybrid applications.

### Frontend Architecture

Most hybrid dApps follow a common frontend pattern:

```javascript
// 1. Initialize TAC SDK
import { TacSdk, Network } from "@tonappchain/sdk";
const tacSdk = await TacSdk.create({ network: Network.TESTNET });

// 2. Connect TON wallet
import { TonConnectUI } from "@tonconnect/ui";
const tonConnect = new TonConnectUI({
  manifestUrl: "https://yourapp.com/tonconnect-manifest.json",
});

// 3. Create cross-chain transactions
const transactionLinker = await tacSdk.sendCrossChainTransaction(
  {
    evmTargetAddress: "0xYourContract",
    methodName: "yourMethod(bytes,bytes)",
    encodedParameters: encodedParams,
  },
  sender,
  assets
);

// 4. Track transaction status
const tracker = new OperationTracker(Network.TESTNET);
const status = await tracker.getOperationStatus(operationId);
```

### Smart Contract Architecture

EVM-side contracts follow standard patterns with TAC-specific proxy integration:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@tac/proxy-contracts/TacProxyV1.sol";

contract HybridDeFiProtocol is TacProxyV1 {
    constructor(address _crossChainLayer) TacProxyV1(_crossChainLayer) {}

    // This function receives cross-chain calls from TON
    function executeSwap(bytes calldata tacHeader, bytes calldata args)
        external
        _onlyCrossChainLayer
    {
        // Decode TAC header to get user info
        TacHeaderV1 memory header = _decodeTacHeader(tacHeader);

        // Decode your application-specific arguments
        SwapParams memory params = abi.decode(args, (SwapParams));

        // Execute your application logic
        performSwap(params);

        // Optionally send results back to TON
        _sendMessageV1(createReturnMessage(header, results));
    }
}
```

## User Journey Example

Let's follow a TON user interacting with a hybrid DEX:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discovery" icon="search">
    User discovers the DEX through a Telegram Mini App or web interface. The app
    looks and feels like a native TON application.
  </Step>

<Step title="Connection" icon="plug">
  User connects their TON wallet (Tonkeeper) using standard TON Connect. No new
  wallets or seed phrases required.
</Step>

<Step title="Asset Selection" icon="coins">
  User selects TON tokens to swap. The interface shows familiar token names and
  balances from their TON wallet.
</Step>

<Step title="Transaction" icon="arrow-right-left">
  User approves the swap in their TON wallet. Behind the scenes, TAC locks their
  tokens and sends a message to the EVM DEX contract.
</Step>

<Step title="Execution" icon="settings">
  The DEX executes the swap using sophisticated AMM logic on the EVM side. The
  user sees real-time status updates in the interface.
</Step>

  <Step title="Completion" icon="check">
    New tokens appear in the user's TON wallet automatically. The entire process
    feels like a native TON transaction.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  The user never knew they were interacting with an EVM application - it felt
  completely native to TON.
</Check>
