---

Get up and running with TAC development quickly by building your first hybrid dApp. This guide will take you from zero to a working application that connects TON wallets with EVM smart contracts in just a few minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install create-tac-app" icon="download">
    The fastest way to bootstrap a TAC project is using our CLI tool:
    
    ```bash
    npx create-tac-app my-tac-project
    ```
    
    This creates a new directory with a fully configured TAC project including:
    - Smart contracts with proxy implementation
    - Frontend with TAC SDK integration
    - TON wallet connection setup
    - Cross-chain messaging examples
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your environment" icon="settings">
    Make sure you have the required tools and accounts:

    - Node.js v18.0.0 or higher
    - Blockchain Accounts:
      - Ethereum wallet with testnet TAC tokens for deployment
      - TON wallet for testing (Tonkeeper or TON Space recommended)
    - Get Testnet Tokens:
      - TAC tokens: [TAC Testnet Faucet](https://spb.faucet.tac.build)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy smart contracts" icon="rocket">
    Navigate to the contracts directory and deploy to TAC testnet:

    ```bash
    cd my-tac-project/contracts
    npm install
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network tacTestnet
    ```

    **Take note of the deployed addresses:**

    - SimpleMessage contract address
    - MessageProxy contract address

    These will be displayed in your console after successful deployment.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Update frontend configuration" icon="settings">
    Open `lib/contract_addresses.ts` and update with your deployed contract addresses:
    
    ```typescript
    export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
      simpleMessage: "0xYourSimpleMessageAddress",
      messageProxy: "0xYourMessageProxyAddress"
    };
    ```
    
    This connects your frontend to the smart contracts you just deployed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the development server" icon="play">
    Return to the project root and start the Next.js development server:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your TAC application is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

    <Check>
      You should see a clean interface with TON Connect integration and example
      messaging functionality.
    </Check>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your TON wallet" icon="wallet">
    Open your application in the browser and:
    1. Click the "Connect Wallet" button
    2. Choose your TON wallet (Tonkeeper, TON Space, etc.)
    3. Approve the connection in your wallet
    4. Verify your wallet address appears in the interface

    The starter app includes a messaging example that demonstrates
    cross-chain communication from TON to your EVM smart contracts.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test cross-chain functionality" icon="arrow-left-right">
    Try the example functionality:
    1. **Send a Message**: Use the message form to send data from TON to your EVM contract
    2. **Track Status**: Watch the transaction progress through cross-chain stages
    3. **View Results**: See the message stored on the EVM side

    This demonstrates the complete flow of hybrid dApp interaction.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Build your dApp" icon="code">
    Now start customizing for your use case:

    **Smart Contracts** (`contracts/` directory):
    - Modify `SimpleMessage.sol` for your business logic
    - Update `MessageProxy.sol` for custom cross-chain handling
    - Add new contracts as needed

    **Frontend** (`pages/` and `components/` directories):
    - Customize the UI components
    - Add new pages and functionality
    - Integrate additional TAC SDK features

    **Cross-Chain Features**:
    - Asset bridging between TON and EVM
    - Multi-step cross-chain workflows
    - Advanced transaction tracking

  </Step>

## Common Issues & Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Contract deployment fails" icon="triangle-alert">
    **Check your setup:**
    - Verify you have testnet TAC tokens in your deployment wallet
    - Ensure your private key is correctly set in `.env`
    - Confirm you're using the correct network configuration

    **Get help:**
    - Check the Hardhat logs for specific error messages
    - Verify contract addresses on the [TAC Explorer](https://spb.explorer.tac.build)

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="TON wallet won't connect" icon="wallet">

**Troubleshooting steps:**

- Make sure you're using a supported TON wallet
- Clear your browser cache and try again
- Check that your wallet is set to TON testnet
- Verify the TON Connect manifest is accessible

</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cross-chain transactions fail" icon="arrow-left-right">
    **Common causes:**
    - Insufficient TON balance for gas fees
    - Invalid contract addresses in configuration
    - Network connectivity issues

    **Solutions:**
    - Check balances in both TON and TAC wallets
    - Verify contract addresses are correct
    - Use the transaction tracking to identify where failures occur
