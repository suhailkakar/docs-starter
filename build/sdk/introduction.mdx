description: "The comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript library for building hybrid dApps that seamlessly connect TON and EVM ecosystems"
---

The TAC SDK is a powerful JavaScript/TypeScript library that enables frontend developers to build **hybrid dApps** with unprecedented ease. By abstracting the complexities of cross-chain messaging, the SDK allows you to focus on creating exceptional user experiences while handling wallet connections, transaction routing, and asset bridging automatically.

<Note>
  The TAC SDK bridges the gap between TON's massive user base and EVM's rich
  DeFi ecosystem, enabling developers to create applications that leverage the
  best of both worlds.
</Note>

## Core Capabilities

The TAC SDK provides four essential capabilities that transform how developers approach cross-chain development:

### Seamless Wallet Integration

Connect users with their existing TON wallets through the standard TON Connect protocol. No additional software installation or new seed phrases required.

```javascript
import { TacSdk, SenderFactory, Network, AssetType } from "@tonappchain/sdk";

// Initialize SDK and connect wallet
const tacSdk = await TacSdk.create({ network: Network.TESTNET });
const sender = await SenderFactory.getSender({ tonConnect: tonConnectUI });
```

### Direct EVM Contract Interaction

Execute complex EVM contract calls directly from TON wallets. The SDK handles all cross-chain message formatting and routing automatically.

```javascript
// Call an EVM DEX directly from TON
const evmProxyMsg = {
  evmTargetAddress: "0x742d35Cc647332...",
  methodName:
    "swapExactTokensForTokens(uint256,uint256,address[],address,uint256)",
  encodedParameters: encodedSwapData,
};

const result = await tacSdk.sendCrossChainTransaction(
  evmProxyMsg,
  sender,
  assets
);
```

### Automatic Asset Bridging

Bridge TON, Jettons, and NFTs to EVM seamlessly. The SDK manages locking, minting, and unlocking across chains without manual intervention.

```javascript
// Bridge multiple assets in a single transaction
const assets = [
  {
    type: AssetType.FT,
    amount: 10.5,
  }, // Native TON
  {
    type: AssetType.FT,
    address: "EQJettonMasterAddress...",
    amount: 1000,
  }, // Jetton tokens
];
```

### Real-Time Operation Tracking

Monitor cross-chain transactions with comprehensive status tracking. Get detailed progress updates and handle completion or failure scenarios gracefully.

```javascript
// Track transaction progress
const tracker = new OperationTracker(Network.TESTNET);
const operationId = await tracker.getOperationId(transactionLinker);
const status = await tracker.getOperationStatus(operationId);
```

## How It Works

The TAC SDK acts as a bridge between your frontend application and TAC's cross-chain infrastructure:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Message Preparation" icon="settings">
    Your application specifies the desired EVM operation using familiar
    JavaScript objects. The SDK validates parameters and encodes them for
    cross-chain delivery.
  </Step>

<Step title="Asset Management" icon="coins">
  The SDK automatically handles asset locking on TON and prepares them for
  minting on the EVM side, managing all complex token mechanics.
</Step>

<Step title="Cross-Chain Routing" icon="arrow-left-right">
  Messages are routed through TAC's sequencer network, which validates
  operations and ensures secure cross-chain delivery.
</Step>

<Step title="EVM Execution" icon="play">
  Your target EVM contracts receive properly formatted calls with bridged
  assets, executing exactly as if called from an EVM wallet.
</Step>

  <Step title="Status Updates" icon="chart-line">
    The SDK provides real-time updates throughout the process, allowing your
    application to show users exactly what's happening.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Developer Experience

The SDK is designed to feel familiar to web developers while providing powerful cross-chain capabilities:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Familiar Patterns">
    Standard async/await patterns, Promise-based error handling, and conventional configuration objects make the SDK feel like any other JavaScript library.
    
    ```javascript
    try {
      const result = await tacSdk.sendCrossChainTransaction(message, sender, assets);
      console.log("Transaction successful:", result.operationId);
    } catch (error) {
      handleTransactionError(error);
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="TypeScript First">
    Comprehensive TypeScript definitions provide excellent IDE support with autocompletion, type checking, and inline documentation.
    
    ```typescript
    interface EvmProxyMsg {
      evmTargetAddress: string;
      methodName?: string;
      encodedParameters?: string;
      gasLimit?: bigint;
    }
    
    const evmProxyMsg: EvmProxyMsg = {
      evmTargetAddress: "0x742d35Cc647332...",
      methodName: "transfer(address,uint256)",
      encodedParameters: encodedTransferData
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Testing & Simulation">
    Built-in testing utilities help validate integrations before deployment, including transaction simulation and automated status tracking.
    
    ```javascript
    // Simulate before executing
    const simulation = await tacSdk.getTransactionSimulationInfo(
      evmProxyMsg,
      sender,
      assets
    );
    
    if (simulation.success) {
      // Proceed with actual transaction
      const result = await tacSdk.sendCrossChainTransaction(evmProxyMsg, sender, assets);
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
