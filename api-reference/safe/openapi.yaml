        Adds a new Safe delegate with a custom label. Calls with same delegate but different label or
        signer will update the label or delegator if a different one is provided
        For the signature we are using TOTP with `T0=0` and `Tx=3600`. TOTP is calculated by taking the
        Unix UTC epoch time (no milliseconds) and dividing by 3600 (natural division, no decimals)
        To generate the signature, this hash needs to be signed: keccak(checksummed address + str(int(current_epoch //
        3600)))
        As an example, if the 0x132512f995866CcE1b0092384A6118EDaF4508Ff delegate is added and epoch=1586779140:
             - `TOTP = epoch // 3600 = 1586779140 // 3600 = 440771`
             - keccak("0x132512f995866CcE1b0092384A6118EDaF4508Ff440771") would be the hash a Safe owner would
             need to sign.`

        Returns all the *executed* transactions for a given Safe address.
        The list has different structures depending on the transaction type:
        - Multisig Transactions for a Safe. `tx_type=MULTISIG_TRANSACTION`.
        - Module Transactions for a Safe. `tx_type=MODULE_TRANSACTION`
        - Incoming Transfers of Ether/ERC20 Tokens/ERC721 Tokens. `tx_type=ETHEREUM_TRANSACTION`
        Ordering_fields: ["timestamp"] eg: `-timestamp` (default one) or `timestamp`

        Note: This endpoint has a bug that will be fixed in next versions of the endpoint. Pagination is done
        using the `Transaction Hash`, and due to that the number of relevant transactions with the same
        `Transaction Hash` cannot be known beforehand. So if there are only 2 transactions
        with the same `Transaction Hash`, `count` of the endpoint will be 1
        but there will be 2 transactions in the list.

        Adds a new Safe delegate with a custom label. Calls with same delegate but different label or
        signer will update the label or delegator if a different one is provided.
        To generate the signature, the following EIP712 data hash needs to be signed:

        ```python
         {
            "types": {
                "EIP712Domain": [
                    {"name": "name", "type": "string"},
                    {"name": "version", "type": "string"},
                    {"name": "chainId", "type": "uint256"},
                ],
                "Delegate": [
                    {"name": "delegateAddress", "type": "address"},
                    {"name": "totp", "type": "uint256"},
                ],
            },
            "primaryType": "Delegate",
            "domain": {
                "name": "Safe Transaction Service",
                "version": "1.0",
                "chainId": chain_id,
            },
            "message": {
                "delegateAddress": delegate_address,
                "totp": totp,
            },
        }
        ```

        For the signature we use `TOTP` with `T0=0` and `Tx=3600`. `TOTP` is calculated by taking the
        Unix UTC epoch time (no milliseconds) and dividing by 3600 (natural division, no decimals).

        Note: This endpoint has a bug that will be fixed in next versions of the endpoint. Pagination is done
        using the `Transaction Hash`, and due to that the number of relevant transactions with the same
        `Transaction Hash` cannot be known beforehand. So if there are only 2 transactions
        with the same `Transaction Hash`, `count` of the endpoint will be 1
        but there will be 2 transactions in the list.
