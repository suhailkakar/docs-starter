TAC provides comprehensive API access through three complementary sets of endpoints: standard EVM JSON-RPC APIs for full Ethereum compatibility, TAC-specific APIs for cross-chain functionality, and Safe APIs for tracking transactions sent via Safe smart contracts.

This multi-layered approach ensures that existing Ethereum tools work seamlessly while providing access to TAC's unique hybrid dApp capabilities and Safe transaction monitoring.

## API Usage

Most developers primarily use **TON Adapter APIs** and **EVM APIs** for building applications on TAC. The **Safe APIs** provide specialized functionality for monitoring Safe smart contract transactions.
